Helpful commands
----------------

Here are some commands that can help you understand your system better.
You can run them locally on any Linux machine as well as on HPC systems.

* ``lstopo``
     lstopo and lstopo-no-graphics are capable of displaying a topological map of the system

* ``htop``
      It is similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally, so you can see all the processes
      running on the system, along with their full command lines.
