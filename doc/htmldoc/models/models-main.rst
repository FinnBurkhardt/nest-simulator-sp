Models in NEST
==============


What we mean by `models`
------------------------

Models in the context of NEST are C++ implmentations of mathematical equations that describe the characteristics and behavior of
different types of neurons, syanpses, (and devices?), based on the relevant peer-reviewed publications for the model.

We also use the term model in relation to network models (e.g., :ref:`microcircuit <toc_microcircuit>` and `multi-area model <https://inm-6.github.io/multi-area-model/>`_). These network models
can be considerd a level of complexity higher than the neuron or synapse model. We do not focus on network models here.

Find a model
------------

NEST provides a ton of models! Textbook standards like integrate-and-fire and Hodgkin-Huxley type models are available
alongside high quality implementations of models published by the neuroscience community.
The models are organized and autogenerated by keywords (e.g., adaptive threshold, conductance-based etc) in our directory. Models that contan a specific keyword will be listed under that word.

* Discover :doc:`all the models in our directory <index>`.

NESTML
------

* Check out :doc:`NESTML <nestml:index>`,  a domain-specific language for neuron and synapse models. These dynamical models can
  be used in simulations of brain activity on several platforms, in particular the NEST Simulator.

NESTML combines:

* fast prototyping
* an easy to understand, yet powerful syntax;
* a flexible processing toolchain, written in Python;
* good simulation performance by means of code generation (C++ for NEST Simulator).




Model naming
------------

Neuron models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Neuron model names in NEST combine abbreviations that describe the dynamics and synapse specifications for that model.
They may also include author's name of a model based on a specific paper.

Example neuron model name

``iaf_cond_beta``

    an implementation of a spiking neuron using integrate and fire dynamics with
    conductance-based synapses. Incoming spike events induce a postsynaptic change
    of conductance modelled by a beta function.

Example neuron model name based on specific paper

``hh_cond_exp_traub``


    a modified version of the Hodgkin Huxley neuron model based on Traub and Miles (1991)

Synapse models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Synapse models  include the word synapse as last word in model name.

Synapse models may begin with author name (e.g., ``clopath_synapsae``) or process (e.g., ``stdp_synase``).

Devices
~~~~~~~

A device name should represent its physical counter point - like a multimeter is ``multimeter``.  In general, the term ``recorder`` is used for devices
that store or generate output. The term  ``generator`` is used for devices that provide input into the simulation.


Table of model terms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table provides the NEST term used for a specific descriptor of a model along with commonly used alternative terms you may find in the literature.
Additional terms may be used to help differentiate models not included in the list below.
See the the :doc:`model directory <index>` to access the full description of each model.
